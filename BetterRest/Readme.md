# Rest Better
## Project 4: Days 26 - 28 of 100 Days of Swift
This is an application for coffee drinkers to work out what time their bedtime should be in order to get the number of hours sleep that they'd like.
In the application, the user sets their wake up time, the number of hours of sleep they'd like to have and the number cups of coffee they
drink. When the user presses calculate, the application uses a machine model to predict what their bedtime should be. Their bedtime is then displayed
to the user in an alert.
