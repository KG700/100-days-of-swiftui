# Unit Converter
## Challenge Day: Day 19 of 100 Days of Swift
This application allows users to convert lengths into different units. The user enters the value and the unit that they would like to convert. Then selects
which unit they would like the length to be converted to. The application will then calculate this conversion and display it back to the user.
